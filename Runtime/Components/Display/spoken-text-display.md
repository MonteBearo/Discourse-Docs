DEPRECATED [Removed: v1.1.0]
{: .label .label-red }


> **Note:** This component has since been removed from Discourse [version 1.1]. Please see the [TextDisplay](text-display.md) component for the new workflow.

The SpokenTextDisplay is responsible for displaying subtitled dialogue text to the screen, and playing audio on an Actor's AudioHandler component. It is used by the built-in Speech node.
