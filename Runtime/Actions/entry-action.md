# Entry

```
Montebearo.Discourse.Entry : DiscourseAction
```

Entry is an [Action](discourse-action.md) that all [Events](../../Key-Assets/discourse-event.md) have, acting as the single point of entry to that Event.

The displayed Property Panel for the Entry action is unique; actually displaying the inspector of the parent Event it belongs to. As such, it is here you can list any required references to SceneCameras and SceneObjects.
